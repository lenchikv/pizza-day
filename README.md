<h2>Pizza Day<h2>

<h3>Introduction </h3>
Every week your team orders pizza delivery. Usually there is up to 20 items (pizzas, juice etc.) per order and the main task of this application calculate how many money every participant has to pay.
<h3>The Problems</h3> 
After pizza was ordered this app should summarize all payments and send it via email to event's creator and the sum of payment for each own order to all participants.And there is another problem. Each time you have 1 or couple coupons for free pizza. To keep order you need split this discount (pizza price) between all coworkers who ordered pizza. 
<h3>App features</h3>
<ul>
<li>sign in/sign up (Google authentication)
<li>create users Groups (so, you don’t need to search for your co workers over whole users list in app). Only Group creator may invite or remove people. Group should have name and image/logo. 
<li>Menu item should contain it’s name and price. Any group participant can create menu items or edit existing ones. 
<li>Group creator is able to add/remove free pizza coupons (each coupon works only for specific pizza (menu item)
<li>create new "Pizza day" Event. Event contains event date, event status (ordering/ordered/delivering/delivered), user’s Group (that takes part in Event). Also, each user from the Group should confirm he is taking part in Event, so he can add order items in this event. 
<li>After Event creating each group participant (user) may choose menu items he want to order (+ specify count). 
<li>When all event participants confirmed their order event status is changing to ordered. So, each user receives to his email list of items he ordered and total amount $ he should pay to event creator.
